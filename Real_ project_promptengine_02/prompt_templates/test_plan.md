Objective 
In this document of the Test Plan for the VWO application, A/B test anything & measure its impact everywhere

Import and aggregate all metrics you care about and measure how they get impacted by your experiments.


Track both leading and lagging indicators for your experiment's impact
Keep an eye on guardrail metrics to stop bad experiments early on

Defect Reporting Procedure

The criteria for identifying a defect, such as deviation from the requirements, user experience issues, or technical errors.

The steps for reporting a defect, such as using a designated template, providing detailed reproduction steps, and attaching screenshots or logs.

The process for triaging and prioritizing defects, such as assigning severity and priority levels, and assigning them to the appropriate team members for investigation and resolution.

The tools and systems that will be used for tracking and managing defects, such as a defect tracking software or a project management tool.

The roles and responsibilities of the team members involved in the defect reporting process, such as testers, developers, and the test lead.

The communication channels and frequencies for updating stakeholders on the progress and status of defects.

The metrics and metrics that will be used to measure the effectiveness of the defect reporting process, such as the number of defects found, the time taken to resolve them, and the percentage of defects that were successfully fixed.

Test Strategy

The first step is to create test scenarios and test cases for the various features in
Scope.

While developing test cases, we'll use a number of test design techniques.
o Equivalence Class Partition
o Boundary Value Analysis
o Decision Table Testing
o State Transition Testing
o Use Case Testing


 We also use our expertise in creating Test Cases by applying the below:
o Error Guessing
o Exploratory Testing
• We prioritize the Test Cases


Step 2: Our testing procedure when we receive a request for testing:


• First, we'll conduct smoke testing to see if the various and
important functionalities of the application are working.

• We reject the build, if the Smoke Testing fails and will wait for the stable
build before performing in depth testing of the application functionalities.

• Once we receive a stable build, which passes Smoke Testing, we perform
in depth testing using the Test Cases created.


• Multiple Test Resources will be testing the same Application on Multiple
Supported Environments simultaneously.


We then report the bugs in bug tracking tool and send dev. management
the defect found on that day in a status end of the day email.


As part of the Testing, we will perform the below types of Testing:
o Smoke Testing and Sanity Testing
o Regression Testing and Retesting
o Usability Testing, Functionality & UI Testing
• We repeat Test Cycles until we get the quality product.



Step3 –  We will follow the below best practices to make our Testing better:

• Context Driven Testing – We will be performing Testing as per the context
of the given application.


• Shift Left Testing – We will start testing from the beginning stages of the
development itself, instead of waiting for the stable build.


• Exploratory Testing – Using our expertise we will perform Exploratory
Testing, apart from the normal execution of the Test cases.


• End to End Flow Testing – We will test the end-to-end scenario which
involve multiple functionalities to simulate the end user flows.

Entry and Exit Criteria
The below are the entry and exit criteria for every phase of Software Testing Life
Cycle:
Requirement Analysis
Entry Criteria:
• Once the testing team receives the Requirements Documents or details
about the Project
Exit Criteria:
• List of Requirements are explored and understood by the Testing team
• Doubts are cleared
	






Test Execution
Entry Criteria:
• Test Scenarios and Test Cases Documents are signed-off by the Client
• Application is ready for Testing
Exit Criteria:
• Test Case Reports, Defect Reports are ready


Test Closure
Entry Criteria:
• Test Case Reports, Defect Reports are ready
Exit Criteria:
• Test Summary Reports



Tools
The following are the list of Tools we will be using in this Project:
• JIRA Bug Tracking Tool
• Mind map Tool
• Snipping Screenshot Tool
• Word and Excel documents

Risks and Mitigations
The following are the list of risks possible and the ways to mitigate them:
Risk: Non-Availability of a Resource
Mitigation: Backup Resource Planning
Risk: Build URL is not working
Mitigation: Resources will work on other tasks
Risk: Less time for Testing
Mitigation: Ramp up the resources based on the Client needs dynamically


Approvals
Team will send different types of documents for Client Approval like below:
• Test Plan
• Test Scenarios
• Test Cases
• Reports
Testing will only continue to the next steps once these approvals are done
